## About
The COGIP is a company which we don't know a lot about apart that they produce Jean-Michel toys and that they are serious workers check. They also have incredible employees within their rank.

Jean-Christian Ranu works in accounting at the COGIP. He has been using an old, ugly and incomplete software for years, making him go between it and excels sheet. Jean-Christian like paella, crosswords and his coworker Muriel Perrache.

Your mission here is to code a web application which will respond to the needs and desire of Jean-Christian.
